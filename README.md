# Chess application

University project done during the PROP subject in FIB, UPC. 2018-2019
 
That year, the subject consisted in creating a desktop chess application in a three group with its own interface and IA using the Java programming language. It was a great effort to program the AI using Minimax algorithm and other stuff. You can try it just uncompressing the .zip files of each delivery.

We wrote a document explaining the Java classes that we used and the IA algorithm, and other document as manual to know how to use the desktop application. You can see  here the [first document](https://github.com/jrefusta/PROP-FIB-ChessApplication/blob/master/Proyecto/docs/Pr%C3%A1ctica%20de%20Prop.pdf) and the [manual]( https://github.com/jrefusta/PROP-FIB-ChessApplication/blob/master/Proyecto/docs/Manual.pdf).
